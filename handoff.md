**Summary of Today’s Accomplishments**

1. **Dynamic Hardware Configuration**  
   • Replaced static `LEFT`/`RIGHT` dicts with a centralized `MOTOR_CONFIG` in **config.py**, enabling easy pin remapping and additional motors.  
   • Added per‑motor `PULSES_PER_REV` to support accurate RPM conversion.

2. **Parameter‑Driven Pulse Scans**  
   • Introduced global scan parameters (`SCAN_DUTY`, `SCAN_INTERVAL`, `SCAN_DURATION`) with a menu interface to tweak duty, interval, and duration at runtime.  
   • Enhanced the `sniff_pulse_scan()` routine to collect rising‑edge counts, compute average pulses/sec, standard deviation, and RPM (using either default or per‑motor PPR).  

3. **Stats Collection & Reporting**  
   • Stored scan results in a `LAST_STATS` table: `{motor_name: (avg_pps, std_pps, avg_rpm)}`.  
   • Added a Main‑Menu command to “Compare last stats” for quick side‑by‑side comparison.

4. **Configurable PWM Ramp**  
   • Moved ramp parameters (`RAMP_MIN_DUTY`, `RAMP_STEP`, `RAMP_DELAY`) into **config.py**.  
   • Created a `pwm_ramp()` helper that starts at a minimum duty to overcome static friction, steps up to 100%, then reverses back down.

5. **Interactive PID Tuning**  
   • Built menu items to configure `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` live, and a simple heuristic to suggest initial values based on scan gain.  
   • Added a global `SETPOINT` for closed‑loop tests with a menu interface to set/clear it.

6. **Auto‑Tuning (Ziegler–Nichols Method)**  
   • Implemented `run_pid_capture()` to execute a P‑only closed‑oop test, recording error zero‑crossings.  
   • Added `auto_tune_pid()` to sweep `Kp` until sustained oscillation, compute ultimate gain \(Ku\) and period \(Pu\), then apply Z‑N formulas to derive final `Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`.

7. **Integration Testing & Validation**  
   • Verified pulse counts and RPM accuracy with updated PPR=90 for both wheels.  
   • Confirmed ramp logic prevents stalling by starting above static friction threshold.

**Handoff & Next Steps**  

• **Git Branch**: You should be on `feature/session-20250425-chatgpt` (or similar).  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/session-$(date +%Y%m%d)-chatgpt
  ```

• **Files Updated**:  
  - `config.py`: Added ramp settings and updated `PULSES_PER_REV` to 90  
  - `zsx11h_test_harness.py`:  
    - Dynamic device loading from `MOTOR_CONFIG`  
    - Parameterized pulse scans & stats storage  
    - Configurable ramp and `pwm_ramp()`  
    - Interactive PID config, suggestions, and auto‑tune routines

• **Documentation TODO**:  
  - Update the project README with:  
    1. Board‑solder instructions (J1 PWM jumper, pot CCW) from the MAD‑EE guide  
    2. How to set up and run the harness (menu walkthrough)  
    3. Wire‑up diagrams for PWM, DIR, BRAKE, STOP, and Hall sensors  

• **Suggested Next Features**:  
  1. **Closed‑Loop Verification**: Add a menu option to run the final PID loop and plot or log speed vs. time.  
  2. **MPH/KPH Conversion**: Prompt for wheel diameter and display speed in user units.  
  3. **Safety Enhancements**: Emergency‑stop key binding and clean‑stop on KeyboardInterrupt.  

✅ **Don’t forget**: `git add`, `git commit -m 'Add auto‑tuning and dynamic config'`, and `git push` your branch for review!
